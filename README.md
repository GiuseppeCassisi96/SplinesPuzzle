# SplinesPuzzle

Splines puzzle is a 3D game in which the player has to reconstruct a Spline or Bezier curve by modifying another example curve. The game was developed using Unity3D. The player has to modify the control points and the nodes vector of the example curve to reconstruct the curve. Once that the player has reconstructed the curve, he can pass to the next level. In total the game is composed by eight levels. In order to draw the Bezier curve, I used the De Casteljau algorithm.
